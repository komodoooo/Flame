# flame
Windows cringeware in C, **eDuCaTiOnAl PuRpOsE OnLy!1!1!**

## Compile to exe
`gcc flame.c o flame`

## Additional notes
Windows Defender (obviously) detects it as a malicious file, you have to disable "real time protection" if you want to execute it.

However, with other antivirus windows defender will disable itself, and **many** antiviruses will not detect it as a malicious file.
